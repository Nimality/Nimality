## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ruslan
## I am involved in QA Automation and Manual Testing, and proficient in JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, and Python. I also have experience in bush and Perl scripting.


I am a seasoned QA Automation Engineer with over 15 years of experience in software testing and development. I possess strong problem-solving skills, critical thinking abilities, and a knack for adapting quickly to technological changes. My expertise lies in the entire testing lifecycle, encompassing requirements analysis, test artifact creation, and the development of automation tests.

I am adept at crafting and executing test cases, generating bug reports using JIRA, and working with both relational and non-relational databases such as SQL, Postgres SQL, and MongoDB. My automation skills extend to UI testing using Selenium/Selenide with JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and Ruby, as well as API testing with JavaScript and Postman. I am familiar with frameworks like PlayWright, WebdriverIO, Cypress, RobotFramework, PyTest, and RSpec. Additionally, I have experience with source control systems like GitHub, GitLab Jenkins, and bug tracking systems such as JIRA, YouTrack and TestRail.
